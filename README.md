# GymWebApp
A progressive web application (PWA) developed with Vue.js, Vuetify, TypeScript, and a Firetstore noSQL database.

Problem:
I used a mobile application to manage my workouts. This included keeping track of which workouts that I completed on which day as well as set and reps for each execise contianed within each workout. One day, this mobile mobile app introduced aggressive advertising that often interrupted and delayed the record keeping of my workouts. 

This PWA Solution will enable user to:
 - schedule a variety workouts on a weekly calendar
 - create custom workouts by compiling a list of execises
 - create custom exercises with configurable sets, reps, and weight
 - record time span of workouts
 - keep record of past workouts including detailed information on sets and reps for each exercise completed during the workout
 - plot past workouts on a calendar so that I can review old workouts and track progress
 - use Web App on mobile device with a user friendly and functional design
